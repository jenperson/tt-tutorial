Model Explorer offers an intuitive and hierarchical visualization of model graphs. It organizes model operations into nested layers, enabling users to dynamically expand or collapse these layers. It provides a range of features to facilitate model exploration and debugging, including the ability to highlight input and output operations, overlay metadata on nodes, display layers in interactive pop-ups, perform searches, show identical layers, GPU-accelerated graph rendering, among others.
